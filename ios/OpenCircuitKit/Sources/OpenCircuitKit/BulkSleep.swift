// Bulk activity/sleep decode — the `0x4c` history stream (docs/PROTOCOL.md §5.3).
//
// Confirmed on FW FR02.018 by aligning captures/sleep_sync_btsnoop.log
// (2026-06-13 overnight sync) to the RingConn app's own readout for that night
// (avg HR 68 / HRV 65 ms / SpO2 98 %, low 93 % ~02:30–03:00). The decisive anchor:
// the decoded SpO2 low-cluster lands at 02:32–03:07, matching the app exactly.
//
// A 0x4c page is `[0x4c][0x00][countdown][N × 23-byte record][xor]`. The counter
// is seconds since `Command.syncEpoch`; records step +0x96 = 150 s, so each record
// is one 2.5-min epoch. Records align to page boundaries (each page body is a whole
// number of records — they do not span pages).
//
// Two record layouts, keyed on byte [8]:
//   • Sleep-vitals epoch ([8] in 0x57…0x63): [4]=HR bpm 🟢, [5]=HRV/RMSSD ms 🟢,
//     [6]=confidence 🟢, [7]=RR×8 🟢 (respiratoryRate below), [8]=SpO2 % 🟢, [10:20]=acti_counts.
//   • Activity/awake epoch ([8]=0x12/0x13): [4]=HR bpm 🟢 (ALL-DAY HR — same head as sleep;
//     confirmed 2026-06-17 by sleep↔activity continuity across all captures, ±4.6 bpm / corr +0.76),
//     [10:20]=acti_counts (motion/intensity blob; [15:20] is just its tail, NOT a separate
//     steps/distance payload — that claim was retracted, PROTOCOL.md §5.3 #93).
//     byte[5] HRV and byte[7] RR ARE present and valid on these epochs (🟢 #185, 6 independent
//     archives): byte[5] is only artifact-inflated while the [15:20] intensity tail is NON-ZERO.
//     SpO2 genuinely is absent — [8] IS the activity tag. The recovered values reach the HealthKit
//     sample path ONLY (measuredHRVRMSSD / measuredRespiratoryRate); the strict sleep-vitals
//     accessors below remain the "ring is measuring sleep" MODE signal that staging consumes.
//     The real steps/distance/activeSeconds record (历史活动响应) is a SEPARATE,
//     still-uncaptured stream — §5.3.1, `RingSession.probeActivityChannels`.
// Respiratory rate IS per-epoch ([7]÷8, ground-truthed). Skin temp is NOT per-epoch here (it's
// read live off the 0x10/0x87 descriptor, §5.4). Sleep stages are not on the wire — compute them
// in Swift (Analytics/SleepDetection), per Phase 5.
//
// Do not add behavior that isn't in PROTOCOL.md. New facts go into the spec (and
// desktop/decode_bulk.py) first, then get ported here.

        //     is not even absorbed into the cluster: it is dropped outright.
