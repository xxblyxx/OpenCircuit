// Sleep-stage classifier — Awake / Light / Deep / REM from the 0x4c per-epoch
// signals (PROTOCOL.md §5.3). The ring does NOT transmit a hypnogram; the RingConn
// app computes stages on-device from the same vitals we decode, so we approximate
// that proprietary algorithm here with standard consumer-wearable heuristics.
//
// ⚠️ APPROXIMATION, NOT GROUND TRUTH. We have no PSG (or even per-epoch app) labels —
// only the app's NIGHT TOTALS to sanity-check against (see the night of 2026-06-14:
// asleep 7:37, awake 43m, REM 1:42, light 4:45, deep 1:10). So this is tuned to be
// physiologically principled and to roughly partition a night the way a wrist/ring
// tracker would; it is NOT validated to reproduce per-epoch stage timing, and the
// exact Deep/REM split should be read as approximate proportions, not a clinical
// hypnogram.
//
// Signals per 150 s epoch (forward-filled across epochs that drop a reading):
//   • HR  [4]  — the spine of the model. Stage bands are set from the NIGHT'S OWN HR
//                distribution (percentiles of the asleep HR), never absolute bpm, so
//                it generalises across people and nights.
//   • HRV [5]  — RMSSD; fused in as a secondary REM cue via its short-term variability.
//   • motion [10:15] — the awake signal (a moving sleeper is awake).
//
// Awake is decided FIRST, and from HR as well as motion: an epoch is awake when its
// motion exceeds the threshold OR its smoothed HR sits a margin above the night's
// sleeping floor. That HR gate is the fix for "lying still but awake" — the motion
// still-block alone counts pre-sleep / quiet-morning wakefulness as sleep, so the
// in-bed window starts hours early and a low-movement morning wake is missed. Sleep
// ONSET/OFFSET are then the start of the first, and end of the last, SUSTAINED asleep
// run; leading/trailing in-bed time outside that span is kept as AWAKE-IN-BED (it is
// time in bed, just not asleep — RingConn's two-window model, efficiency = asleep /
// time-in-bed), never counted as sleep. (REM and quiet wake
// overlap in HR, so the wake margin is set deliberately wide — above REM elevation —
// and short HR-only awake runs erode back to asleep so a REM bump can't punch a hole.)
//
// Stage logic, per asleep epoch:
//   • Deep  — HR near the night's minimum (low percentile) AND low HR variability AND
//             no motion: the calm, consolidated low-HR troughs.
//   • REM   — HR elevated toward waking OR HR/HRV notably variable, but motion ~0
//             (muscle atonia). Variability — not absolute HR — is what separates REM
//             from Light, matching the physiology.
//   • Light — everything else asleep (the remainder).
// Bands are percentiles of the TRIMMED (in-window) asleep distribution, so pre-sleep
// wakefulness no longer pollutes them. Stages persist in real sleep, so short Deep/REM
// runs are smoothed back to Light to avoid single-epoch flapping.
