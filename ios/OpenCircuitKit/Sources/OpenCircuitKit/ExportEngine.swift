// Pure export serialization — no SwiftData dependency (#80). Callers fetch from the
// store and pass plain structs here, so these functions are unit-testable on the CLI.
//
// Three formats:
//   • samplesCSV   — one row per QuantitySample-equivalent (HR / SpO2 / temp / HRV / RR)
//   • sleepCSV     — one row per persisted nightly sleep summary
//   • dailyCSV     — one row per day's step rollup
//   • toJSON       — all three tables as a single JSON bundle with an exportedAt timestamp
//
// Timestamps: ISO 8601 with millisecond precision for sample start/end; yyyy-MM-dd for
// date-only fields (sleep night, daily rollup day) to keep the file readable.
//
// SCHEMA v3 (rich export). v3 is a strict SUPERSET of v2: every key v2 emitted is still
// emitted, at the same JSON path, with byte-identical bytes — there is no dual emitter and no
// compatibility mode, so a consumer written against v2 keeps working and `ExportSchemaV3Tests`
// is what stops that promise from rotting. New material (per-session sleep with its hypnogram,
// export metadata, sampling coverage, provenance/units/notes) lands only in NEW keys and NEW
// CSV sections.
//
// Two timestamp policies, deliberately: the v2 sections keep printing UTC ("…Z") because
// changing them would break the superset promise, while every NEW section prints the device's
// local UTC offset (`offsetISO8601`) so it agrees with the yyyy-MM-dd `night`/`day` labels,
// which have always been local. `ExportMetadata.timestampPolicy` states both facts in the file
// itself so a consumer never has to infer which is which.
