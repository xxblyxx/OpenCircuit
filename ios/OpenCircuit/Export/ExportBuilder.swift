// ExportBuilder — the ONE place a data export is assembled (#80, rich schema v3).
//
// The row collection used to be inlined in `ExportView.runExport()`. It moved here the moment a
// SECOND caller appeared (`ExportRingDataIntent`): a Shortcuts automation is the path a user sets
// up once and then never eyeballs again, so a second copy of this logic would drift silently and
// the automated export would stop matching the one the user sees on screen — with nobody there to
// notice. One implementation, two callers.
//
// Strictly READ-ONLY over already-stored data: no BLE, no HealthKit, no network. Everything here
// reads the SwiftData store that the ordinary sync already filled.
//
// WHY THIS RUNS ON THE MAIN ACTOR, AND WHAT BOUNDS IT
// ---------------------------------------------------
// `LocalStore` wraps a `ModelContext` that is not `Sendable`, and every one of its ~90 methods is
// main-actor-isolated; the app has exactly one container, published at launch, whose creation path
// carries the #40/#131 wipe-and-recover scars. Handing the export a second, background context is a
// real refactor of the store's isolation, not a local change — and this project has already paid
// for "large change to fix an orthogonal concern" once (F12/PR #121). So the export stays on the
// main actor and is BOUNDED instead, because an unbounded main-thread pass is the same shape as the
// 0x8BADF00D scene-update watchdog kill this app has already shipped once.
//
// The bound, per table, measured against what the store can actually hold:
//   • StoredSample (the big one: HR/HRV/SpO2/RR/temp), StoredStepSample, StoredDaytimeTemp —
//     bounded at `LocalStore.sampleRetentionDays` (30) by `pruneExpiredSamples`, which runs at
//     launch. A range wider than 30 days cannot fetch more raw rows than a 30-day one.
//   • historySyncEvidence — 24 entries / 3 days (`ObservabilityStore.historySyncEvidenceLimit`).
//   • StoredSleepSummary / StoredDaily — one row per night/day and kept LONG-TERM, so these are the
//     only tables that grow with install age. Each night additionally decodes a hypnogram blob and
//     emits one CSV row per segment, so `hypnogramCSV` is the one section whose size is O(nights).
//     `maxExportDays` caps that at a year; the file's own `meta.rangeStart`/`rangeEnd` then state
//     the window actually exported, so a clamped file can never misrepresent itself.
//
// v3 is a SUPERSET of v2: every section the previous schema emitted is still collected the same
// way, in the same order, and the new sections are appended after it — so a consumer that split
// the CSV on blank lines and indexed the sections positionally still finds every old section at
// its old index.
