// An active link to a connected ring: discovers the notify/write characteristics
// by UUID, enables notifications, sends commands, and decodes responses through
// OpenCircuitKit's confirmed codec. Spec-supported behavior implemented:
//   • live-HR poll (0x95 → 0x15, LiveHR.decode 🟡)
//   • history sync: drain 0x4c activity/sleep pages → BulkSleep → HR/HRV/SpO2
//     samples (PROTOCOL.md §5.3, 🟢 fields). 0x47 PPG pages are acked and decoded
//     diagnostically-only: 0x47 is a sparse ~15-min perfusion trend, not a
//     pulse-resolution waveform (PROTOCOL.md §5.2), so it never feeds HealthKit.
//   • Layer-A epoch page routing (0x47/0x4c/0x50) also feeds EpochSyncSession in
//     parallel, gated behind `epochDecodingEnabled` (intentionally false — 0x47 is
//     diagnostic-only, so no epoch stream is routed into samples; see PPGTrend.swift).

    // firmware and timezones:
    //   • Gen 2 / FR02.018 (ET): the ring streamed 208 contiguous records (00:15→08:53, 8.6 h) as
    //     35 pages between 08:56:16 and 08:57:02, remaining-counter 202→0 unbroken. 174 records
    //     were acked with no drain open and dropped; the night was reported as 1 h 25 m.
