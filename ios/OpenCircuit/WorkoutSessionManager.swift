// WorkoutSessionManager.swift — App-side workout session: HR collection via the ring's
// existing live-HR poll path, GPS route capture (phone CoreLocation), and HKWorkout write.
//
// RISK — Issue #45 (live HR flakiness):
//   The 0x95→0x15 live-HR path has no background refresh; on-demand polling often misses
//   updates. A long workout session is the worst-case scenario for this flakiness. This
//   manager tolerates HR dropouts gracefully: only ACTUAL decoded readings are recorded;
//   gaps are never filled by interpolation or fabrication. A best-effort note is surfaced
//   to the user in the UI. See #45 for the root cause and expected follow-up.
//
// GPS: phone-side only (CoreLocation). The ring has no GPS. Route capture is opt-in —
//   only for outdoor sport types — and gracefully degrades when location permission is
//   denied (workout still proceeds without a route).
//
// HealthKit: writes HKWorkout + HR quantity samples + HKWorkoutRoute (outdoor only).
//   Sport type is mapped to HKWorkoutActivityType; active calories are labeled ESTIMATE.
